## ðŸ§  CAPTCHA Strategy

Indian court websites use CAPTCHA and view-state tokens that block programmatic scraping.

We attempted automation using Selenium. However, due to CAPTCHA, real-time scraping was *not possible within the assignment scope*.  
Hence, the backend simulates the scraping logic using realistic placeholder values.
